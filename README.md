I do not want to take your information, um, I am a business, uh, I am 13, with full permission from my parents, trying to make my apps because Apple does not understand little people, little kids, want to be able to make apps. I need you to approve this. This is also a business website and saying I am not taking your information. Please, just pull some favors. I'm 13.
